# Sifter and TSLang Examples
This directory contains a number of examples demonstrating the use of TSLang in
general and Sifter in particular.

- `turing_machine/` demonstrates the use of `TSLang` rules to simulate a simple
  Turing machine.
- `letter_analogy/` shows how to use `mapper` to solve a simple letter analogy
  of the form `abc->bcd`, `lmn->mno`, `def->?`.
- `program_analysis/` shows how to use `mapper` to solve a number of different
  analogy problems involving source code. In particular, it contains the demos
  discussed in our Onward! 2020 paper.
